SwiftStream
===========

Image lazy-loader for WordPress.

## Installation

This module can be easily installed by adding `10up/swiftstream` to your `composer.json` file. Then, either autoload your Composer dependencies or manually `include()` the `SwiftStream.php` bootstrap file.

Additionally, you must define `SWIFTSTREAM_PATH` somewhere in your project to point to the HTTP path of your SwiftStream installation, otherwise the script loader will not be activated.
